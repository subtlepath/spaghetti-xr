![SpaghettiPad racing on Toad's Turnpike with full touch controls on a physical iPad](docs/screenshots/ipad-race-highway.jpg)

SpaghettiPad packages the full
[SpaghettiKart](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/SpaghettiKart) source port
as a native iOS/iPadOS app. It brings Mario Kart 64 to the screen in your
hands with Metal rendering, true analog touch steering, a grip-first control
layout, Files-based setup, built-in Bluetooth controller routing, and optional
enhanced visuals.

This repository contains the mobile integration, maintained patches, and
reproducible build scripts. It does **not** contain Mario Kart 64, a ROM,
extractable or playable Nintendo game assets, a playable ROM-derived archive,
or MK64 Reloaded. Gameplay screenshots are retained as documentation. Read
the scoped [rights and licensing boundary](RIGHTS_AND_LICENSES.md); it does
not relicense SpaghettiKart, its dependencies, texture packs, or game
material.

## Built for racing on glass

The touch layout keeps the controls under your thumbs and the race visible.
The left side puts L and Z above a full-analog stick. The right side keeps R
and a second Z above A and B, with Start deliberately separated from the
action controls.

Touch is not painted over the whole display: empty space still belongs to the
game, the settings menu hides the race controls while open, and the persistent
`•••` button always provides a way back.

These are current physical-iPad captures using locally supplied game data.
The ROM and optional texture pack used to create them are not part of this
repository.

## Local multiplayer is part of the port

![Four-player Mario Kart 64 character selection running in SpaghettiPad on iPad](docs/screenshots/ipad-four-player-select.jpg)

SpaghettiPad carries four N64 controller ports, deterministic connection-order
assignment, and SpaghettiKart's split-screen modes into the native iOS build.
The touch controller parks itself when hardware controllers are present and
returns after the last one disconnects.

Four-player selection is working, and two-player split-screen rendering has
been exercised. Full physical-controller Grand Prix, VS, battle, reconnect,
and sustained three/four-player performance remain documented hardware gates;
the README does not turn a working menu into an unearned compatibility claim.

## Enhanced textures, built into the experience

Optional texture packs are first-class app content, not a manual desktop
patch. Copy a compatible SpaghettiKart `.o2r` into the Files-visible `mods`
folder, relaunch, then use **Enhancements → Texture Packs** to choose original
or enhanced graphics. SpaghettiPad reports whether the pack is missing,
detected, loaded, enabled, or waiting for a relaunch.

[MK64 Reloaded](https://evilgames.eu/texture-packs/mk64-reloaded.htm) HD has
been imported and rendered on a physical iPad. No texture pack is bundled,
downloaded, mirrored, or redistributed by this project.

## Install status

| Option | Status | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| Local iPhone/iPad build | **Available now** | Build and sign with your own Apple development team by following [Build from source](docs/BUILDING.md). |
| Simulator | **Available now** | Use it for development and UI testing. It cannot replace physical-device acceptance. |
| Developer-preview `.ipa` | **Available now** | Download the [unsigned ROM-free preview](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/spaghettipad/releases/tag/v0.1.0-preview.3), verify its checksum, and re-sign it with your own Apple development identity. |
| App Store / TestFlight | **Not announced** | No App Store listing or public TestFlight exists. |

The current development build has been signed, update-installed, and played
on a physical iPad and iPhone. Files import, local `mk64.o2r` loading, touch
gameplay, menus, audio, saves, local multiplayer paths, and MK64 Reloaded HD
have been exercised on iPad. The customizable phone layout, A hold assist,
safe-area menu placement, texture-pack rendering, and Grand Prix play have
also been exercised on iPhone.

Those results do not certify every configuration. The published Preview 3
artifact has been audited; its exact payload has been temporarily re-signed,
update-installed, launched, and verified live on a physical iPhone. Signed
development builds have also been installed, launched, and touch-tested on a
physical iPad.
Bluetooth-controller mapping and reconnect behavior, sustained multiplayer
performance, a complete touch-only Grand Prix, and a complete tilt-driven
Grand Prix remain explicit validation gates.

## Get started

You need:

- a Mac with Xcode and its command-line tools;
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh);
- an Apple ID configured in Xcode for physical-device signing; and
- your own legally acquired Mario Kart 64 **US 1.0, big-endian `.z64`** ROM.

The supported ROM has SHA-1:

```text
579c48e211ae952530ffc8738709f078d5dd215e
```

Install the host dependencies:

```sh
brew install cmake ninja pkgconf sdl2 glew nlohmann-json libpng libzip \
  tinyxml2 libogg libvorbis opus opusfile sdl2_net ripgrep
```

Clone and build:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/chrissotraidis/spaghettipad.git
cd spaghettipad

# Simulator
scripts/build-ios.sh --simulator

# Physical iPhone or iPad
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=ABCDE12345 \
BUNDLE_ID=com.yourname.spaghettipad \
scripts/build-ios.sh --device
```

Replace `ABCDE12345` with the 10-character team identifier shown in Xcode and
use a bundle identifier that belongs to you. Keep that bundle identifier
unchanged for later update installs so iOS can retain the app container.

The device app is written to:

```text
build-ios/Release-iphoneos/SpaghettiPad.app
```

If Xcode needs to register the device or create a provisioning profile, open
`build-ios/Spaghettify.xcodeproj`, select the `Spaghettify` scheme and your
device, then choose your team under **Signing & Capabilities**.

See [the complete build guide](docs/BUILDING.md) for pinned-source,
package-audit, and signing details. Before sharing a source snapshot or build,
follow the [release checklist](docs/RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md).

## First launch

SpaghettiPad never downloads or bundles game data.

1. Launch SpaghettiPad once so iOS creates its Files-visible folder.
2. Open **Files → On My iPad/iPhone → SpaghettiPad**.
3. Move your supported `.z64` into that folder.
4. Return to SpaghettiPad and tap **Rescan**.
5. Keep the app open while it validates the ROM and creates local
   `mk64.o2r`.
6. Relaunch if instructed, then press the on-screen Start button.

The ROM and generated game archive remain in the app container. They are
ignored by Git and rejected by the repository's app and package audits.

Maintainers may instead use `scripts/generate-port-archive.sh` to create a
local `ref/mk64.o2r`, then copy that archive into the installed app's
Files-visible folder. `ref/` is ignored local storage; never commit or upload
its contents.

## Touch controls

The current controller is arranged for landscape play:

- **Left:** L and Z above the full-analog control stick.
- **Right:** Z and R above A and B, plus Start and the four C buttons.
- **Menu:** the persistent `•••` button opens settings and stays reachable
  when gameplay controls are hidden.
- **Layout editor:** use **Settings → Controls → Customize Touch Layout** to
  move controls, resize them from 70% to 150%, or hide unused buttons.
- **Touch toggle:** use **Settings → Controls → Touch Controls** to hide or
  restore the gameplay overlay.
- **Legacy toggle:** use **Settings → Controls → Legacy Touch Controls** to
  restore the original fixed layout without customization or A hold assist.
- **Tilt:** opt-in steering, sensitivity, and recenter controls are under
  **Settings → Controls**.

The touch D-pad is intentionally omitted because Mario Kart 64's normal racing
controls do not use it. Hold A for 0.65 seconds during a race, then lift your
finger to keep accelerating; the `A •` label and a short haptic confirm the
hold. Tap A again to release it. Z and R always remain momentary. Opening the
menu releases held input and hides the gameplay controls; closing it restores
them only when Touch Controls is enabled.

Phone and tablet layouts are saved separately and survive relaunches. See
[Touch controls](docs/TOUCH_CONTROLS.md) for editor behavior, safety releases,
legacy mode, and current physical-device validation.

| Touch control | Mario Kart 64 action |
|---|---|
| Analog stick | Steer and navigate |
| A | Accelerate / confirm; race-only hold assist |
| B | Brake, reverse / cancel |
| Z | Use or hold an item |
| R | Hop, drift, and powerslide |
| L | Cycle the race display |
| Start | Pause / start |
| C buttons | Camera and display controls used by the game |
| `•••` | Open or close the SpaghettiKart menu |

## Physical controllers

SpaghettiPad includes SpaghettiKart/libultraship's SDL game-controller input
path and a pinned controller mapping database. The iOS integration installs
default SDL mappings for all four N64 ports. Controllers are assigned by
connection order: first to player 1, second to player 2, through player 4.
When a physical controller is detected, the touch gameplay overlay parks so it
does not send duplicate player-1 input; it returns after the last controller
disconnects.

The default extended-gamepad layout is:

| Physical control | Mario Kart 64 input |
|---|---|
| Left stick | Analog stick / steering |
| South face button (`A` on Xbox) | A / accelerate |
| West face button (`X` on Xbox) | B / brake and reverse |
| Left trigger | Z / use or hold item |
| Right shoulder or trigger | R / hop and drift |
| Left shoulder | L |
| Menu/Start | Start |
| Right stick up/right | C-up/C-right |
| North/east face buttons | C-left/C-down |
| D-pad | N64 D-pad |

That describes the implemented path, not a blanket hardware certification.
Automatic button mapping, reconnect behavior, rumble, and sustained
one-to-four-player sessions still require physical testing across Xbox,
PlayStation, Nintendo, and MFi controller models. See
[Physical-device acceptance](docs/HARDWARE_ACCEPTANCE.md) for the exact gate.

## Texture packs

SpaghettiPad supports compatible SpaghettiKart `.o2r` texture packs but does
not provide, download, mirror, or relicense them. To use
[MK64 Reloaded](https://evilgames.eu/texture-packs/mk64-reloaded.htm):

1. Download the **SpaghettiKart HD `.o2r`** from the author's official page.
2. In Files, create or open
   **On My iPad/iPhone → SpaghettiPad → mods**.
3. Move the `.o2r` into `mods`.
4. Relaunch SpaghettiPad once so the engine can load the new archive.
5. Open **••• → Enhancements → Texture Packs**.
6. Confirm the status says the pack is loaded, then use
   **Use Enhanced / HD Texture Pack**.

Adding or replacing an archive requires one relaunch. Turning the imported
pack on or off also requires a restart because the engine mounts the archive
when it starts; the app explains that current race progress will be lost,
saves the selection, and closes only after you confirm. Reopen SpaghettiPad
manually from the Home Screen; iOS does not allow an app to relaunch itself.
Cancel leaves the running state unchanged. The Texture Packs page reports
whether a pack is absent, detected but awaiting a relaunch, loaded and off,
loaded and on, or waiting to apply a change. Start with HD. Treat 4K as an
M-series-iPad performance experiment until it has its own hardware evidence.

## Current validation

> **The project pivoted to a native visionOS app for Apple Vision Pro on
> 2026-08-01.** The table below records what was measured on the iPadOS lane
> and remains true of the released Preview 3 artifact, but that lane is no
> longer maintained and its open gates were retired unmet. The rest of this
> README still describes the iPadOS build and is rewritten with the visionOS

>
> The visionOS lane has **no published artifact**, but it now has hardware

> holds its picture on a screen fixed in the room, at 89–90 Hz, with **every one
> of 33,601 presented drawables carrying an ARKit device anchor** — the thing a
> headset requires before it will present anything at all. The eyes' separation
> was measured at **68.4–70.7 mm**, and the screen demonstrably stays put as the

>
> That run lasted 6 min 15 s, which the project owner accepted in place of the
> ten minutes the gate asks for, and they report it as comfortable with the
> game's audio playing correctly.
>
> Input was the next gate, and the obstacle turned out to be self-inflicted
> rather than absent: this lane's own window backend drained SDL's event queue
> every frame, throwing away the one event that makes the engine open a gamepad.
> No controller could have worked on any platform here. With that fixed on
> 2026-08-01, **the owner drove a race on the headset, won it, and reports the
> session as comfortable** — which closes Phase 4. The controller was a pair of
> **PS VR2 Sense controllers**, which turn out to enumerate as a single combined
> gamepad; the device log names them, and it is the record here rather than
> anyone's recollection.
>
> What is **not** claimed: the Sense controllers' **6DoF pose**, which needs an
> ARKit accessory provider that remains a logged refusal — they worked as an
> ordinary gamepad, buttons and sticks; a **DualSense**, which has never been
> connected to this app; port order across reconnects; and multiplayer.
>
> Making the game itself surround the viewer — rather than hanging one flat
> picture of it in 3D — is **written as of 2026-08-01 and unverified**. The engine
> now interprets each frame's display list once per eye, substituting that eye's
> own frustum and position for the game's projection and shifting the HUD's
> orthographic passes to a fixed comfortable distance. It builds, replays clean
> from the pinned revisions, and passes the audit. **Nobody has seen it**: the
> Vision Pro Simulator reports a single view, so the stereo path declines there by
> design and only its flat fallback has been exercised. Whether two interpreter
> passes hold 90 Hz, whether they hold it with the 4K texture pack, and whether
> the world scale is anywhere near right are all open questions for a wearer.
>
> The **MK64 Reloaded 4K pack** does import, load, and render on this lane, which
> is a Simulator result: resident memory roughly triples and the pack's own art is
> visible. Its performance on the headset is not claimed. The phase queue

| Area | Current result |
|---|---|
| Native app | arm64 iPhoneOS and arm64 Simulator builds target iOS/iPadOS 15+ |
| Rendering | Metal rendering works in Simulator and on a physical iPad |
| Game setup | Files-visible supported-ROM import and local `mk64.o2r` loading work |
| Touch | Analog steering and race controls have been exercised on a physical iPad; full acceptance still requires the documented touch-only GP |
| Texture packs | MK64 Reloaded HD has been imported, loaded, and rendered on a physical iPad; full-GP performance evidence remains |
| Saves and updates | Development update installs have retained the current app container; the final audited update/save-preservation gate remains |
| Controllers | Four-port routing and split-screen rendering pass deterministic Simulator tests; physical model, reconnect, and multiplayer sessions remain |
| Tilt | The persisted motion-to-stick path, recentering, touch priority, and foreground recalibration pass Simulator tests; physical feel and a tilt GP remain |
| Packaging | Preview 3 packages the promoted customizable controls in an audited, ROM-free unsigned IPA; its exact payload has been re-signed and launched on a physical iPhone |
| CI | Repository safety and the ROM-free unsigned iPhoneOS build/package workflow pass on hosted GitHub Actions |

The project deliberately keeps build, Simulator, process, and physical-device
evidence separate. The [remaining-work ledger](docs/remaining-work.md) records
the detailed proof and open gates.

## Supported game

| Game | Engine | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Mario Kart 64 US 1.0** | [SpaghettiKart](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/SpaghettiKart) | Supported |
| Other Nintendo 64 games or ROM revisions | Other source ports/emulators | Not supported by this app |

SpaghettiPad is a native integration of one source port, not a general
Nintendo 64 emulator. A different game or ROM revision cannot be substituted.

## Reproducible and ROM-free

The normal compile never reads your ROM. `scripts/build-ios.sh` fetches exact
upstream revisions, disables their push URLs, applies the maintained patches,
generates the ROM-free `spaghetti.o2r`, and builds the app. Your game data is
introduced only after installation.

To create an unsigned, re-signable preview package from an unsigned device
build:

```sh
scripts/package-ios.sh
```

The default command refuses a signed app. Locally signed packaging is an
explicit maintainer-only mode: `REQUIRE_SIGNED=1 scripts/package-ios.sh`.
The packager audits the bundle and rejects Simulator products, original ROMs,
ROM-derived `mk64*.o2r`/`.otr` files, imported texture packs, unexpected port
archive contents, and stale signing material. The public package contract is
an unsigned IPA that the installer signs with their own Apple ID; do not
distribute a maintainer development profile.

## Frequently asked questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Where is the IPA?</strong></summary>

The [current developer preview](https://github.com/chrissotraidis/spaghettipad/releases/tag/v0.1.0-preview.3)
provides an audited, ROM-free unsigned IPA plus its SHA-256 checksum. Follow
[the installation guide](docs/INSTALL_IPA.md) to verify and re-sign it with
your own Apple development identity.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does this repository include Mario Kart 64?</strong></summary>

No. You must provide your own legally acquired supported ROM. Do not open
issues requesting game data, extracted assets, or download links.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does it support Bluetooth controllers?</strong></summary>

The native SDL controller path, mapping database, and four-player port routing
are included. Physical controller models and reconnect behavior are still
being verified, so support is not yet advertised as universal.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can the HD texture pack be bundled with SpaghettiPad?</strong></summary>

No. Texture packs remain optional third-party content obtained by the user
from the pack author's official page. SpaghettiPad only provides the Files
import and enable/disable workflow.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does SpaghettiPad require JIT or a jailbreak?</strong></summary>

No. It is a native arm64 source-port build. A sideloaded IPA still requires
normal iOS code signing, but gameplay does not require JIT.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this an App Store or TestFlight release?</strong></summary>

No. App Store, TestFlight, AltStore PAL, AltStore Classic, and SideStore
distribution have different signing, review, account, and regional
requirements. None should be implied until that exact path is published and
tested.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is the licensing status?</strong></summary>

Each upstream component retains its own license and copyright. The pinned
SpaghettiKart revision has no top-level license, so this project does not
represent its binary-redistribution terms as settled. See
[RIGHTS_AND_LICENSES.md](RIGHTS_AND_LICENSES.md); public source access does not
grant rights to Nintendo material or third-party texture packs.
